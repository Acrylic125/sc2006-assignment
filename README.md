# SC2006 Assignment

## Setup / Workflow
We have 2 folders, 
- `scrape` used for scraping data.gov, parsing and transforming and loading data into the database.
- `app` used for the web app.

**NOTE:** The `db` folder must be kept in sync for both folders.

Refer to the respective folder's `README.md` for more info.
